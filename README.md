# Prism

</div>

A browser extension to erase short form content on YouTube and Instagram.

## Motivation
As a student, I want to help everyone focus on their goals and dreams by eradicating the distraction of short form content. 
I remember how hours used to fly by when I first installed Instagram and when YouTube introduced shorts. 
Fortunately, I had realized my mistakes and got back to studies before it was too late.

## Installation:

Here is a very beginner friendly step by step installation process.

### Prerequisites

- Any Chromium-based browser (like [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/), [Arc](https://arc.net/)). If you're not sure, chances are the browser you're using is based on Chromium.

### Download the extension

You can download the extension from the [releases page](https://github.com/Krazy0P/Prism/releases/tag/prism).


### Or alternatively, clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Krazy0P/Prism.git
cd Prism
```
### Load the Extension in Your Browser

#### Google Chrome and Other Chromium-Based Browsers

1. Open your browser and go to `chrome://extensions/`. (Don't worry if you're using a different Chromium based browser, it will redirect you to the correct page!)
2. Enable "Developer mode" by clicking the toggle switch in the top right corner.
3. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the cloned repository folder.

Yay, now your extension should now be loaded and ready to use.

### Usage

- Open YouTube or Instagram and enjoy a cleaner experience without short form content.
