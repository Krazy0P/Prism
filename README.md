# Prism

</div>

A browser extension to erase short form content on YouTube and Instagram.

## Motivation
As a student, I want to help everyone focus on their goals and dreams by eradicating the distraction of short form content. 
I remember how hours used to fly by when I first installed Instagram and when YouTube introduced shorts. 
Fortunately, I had realized my mistakes and got back to studies before it was too late.

Yay, now your extension should now be loaded and ready to use.
